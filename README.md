# Web Engineering 2016

This repository contains samples used during the [Business Informatic Group's](http://www.big.tuwien.ac.at) Web Engineering lecture series 2016 at [Vienna University of Technology](http://www.tuwien.ac.at).

#Web Services talk

In the Web Services talk we have introduced SOAP/WSDL Web Services and RESTful Web Services. The following two projects provide simple Java projects for SOAP/WSDL and RESTful Web Services.

##arithmetic-webservice

Contains a simple SOAP/WSDL Arithmetic Service. Simply launch the application's main class `at.ac.tuwien.big.we.webservice.ArithmeticService`and access the WSDL under `http://localhost:8080/arithmeticservice?wsdl`

Use [SOAP-UI](http://www.soapui.org) in order to send sample requests to the Web Service.
